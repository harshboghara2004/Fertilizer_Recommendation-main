# Fertilizer Recommendation

The Fertilizer Recommendation System is a web application developed using Flask and Python that assists farmers and agricultural experts in determining the optimal fertilizer mix for their crops. The system estimates the Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels required for a specific crop based on various parameters such as soil type, crop type, and environmental conditions.
